# Stock_Analysis

## Purpose
The Purpose of this project was to find the best stock to invest in. To do that I took the 2017 and 2018 daily open and close prices from 12 different stocks and found their overall return percentage per year.  Then, I formatted te results so the positive stocks stood out in [go] green and the failing stocks in [negative] red. Lastly, I refactored the macro to be capable of performing this analysis on the entire stock market.
